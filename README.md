# 🌙 SleepLens: Clinical Sleep Data Analytics Platform

**SleepLens** is a modern, end-to-end data engineering project designed to ingest, process, and visualize large-scale sleep study data. It provides health professionals with a clinical-grade dashboard to analyze patient sleep architecture, detect apnea events, and monitor population health trends.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The pipeline follows a modern ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture orchestrated by **Kestra**.

### Data Flow
1.  **Ingestion**: `fetch_public_summary.py` generates synthetic sleep study data (mimicking IoMT devices) and stores it as raw CSVs.
2.  **Loading**: `upload_to_snowflake.py` loads raw data into the **Snowflake** Data Cloud (`RAW` schema).
3.  **Transformation**: **dbt** (Data Build Tool) transforms raw data into analytics-ready models:
    *   **Staging**: Cleans and normalizes raw tables.
    *   **Marts**: Creates business logic tables like `fct_sleep_summary` and `fct_event_rates` with calculated metrics.
4.  **Orchestration**: **Kestra** schedules and manages the entire dependency graph, running daily.
5.  **Visualization**: A **Streamlit** dashboard connects directly to Snowflake to present clinical insights (AHI, Sleep Stages).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Orchestration**: Kestra (Dockerized)
*   **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake
*   **Transformation**: dbt Core
*   **Language**: Python 3.12
*   **Visualization**: Streamlit
*   **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose, Terraform (AWS)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   Snowflake Account (Trial or Standard)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sleeplens.git
    cd sleeplens
    ```

2.  **Configure Credentials**:
    Update `transformations/dbt/profiles.yml` with your Snowflake credentials.

3.  **Start Services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
    ```

### Usage

#### 1. Run the Pipeline (Automated)
You can trigger the full end-to-end pipeline using the helper script:
```bash
./scripts/run_snowflake.sh
```

#### 2. Run Automation (Kestra)
Access the Kestra UI at `http://localhost:8081`. 
*   **Username**: `admin`
*   **Password**: `admin`
*   Trigger the `sleeplens_pipeline` flow to see the orchestration in action.

#### 3. Launch Dashboard
Run the clinical dashboard to view the results:
```bash
uv run streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

## � CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration:
*   **Linting**: Enforces code quality with `flake8` (Python) and `sqlfluff` (SQL).
*   **Validation**: Runs `dbt compile` to ensure model integrity.
*   **Build**: Verifies Docker image compilation.

## �📊 Dashboard Features

The dashboard is designed for health professionals and includes:
*   **Clinical Overview**: Real-time calculation of **Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)**.
*   **Population Health**: Analysis of sleep disorders across age and sex cohorts.
*   **Patient Drill-Down**: Individual patient scorecards comparing their sleep architecture to population averages.
